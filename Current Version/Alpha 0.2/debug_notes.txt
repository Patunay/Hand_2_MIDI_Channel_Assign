debug example 4
possible solutions
refine midi ticks to absolute timing conversion
lower certainity threshhold
ioncrese radious of landmark

some contours are not landmarks rendering...(not huge problem since logic layer 3 fixes it)
some handcrossing will output a incorrect guess (because lower hand is hidden under higher hand and then is p[orccesed as a 1st instance])

BIG ISSUE!!!!!
starting at 1238, 3rd option is giving inverse results 
###



0
hand not recognized (hnr)

38
hnr

913
handcrossing

1009
hnr

1183-1191
hnr (unjustifiable)

1238-1239
? right hand clearly closer

--------------
Maybe:
- For events where there is no recognized hand, assign individual channel
- Only process landmarks [4,8,12,16,20]


- Restructure code:
    - Figure out a better way of getting handness attribute list
    - Only get landmarks [4,8,12,16,20] for each hand
    - If no hand detected, route event to renegade_buffer
    - in for midi_off events, check if value present in regular_buffer OR renegade_buffer
    - values of renegade_buffer route to separate midi channel

For debugging, show: interest landmarks, Handness on landmark 0, and landmark individual

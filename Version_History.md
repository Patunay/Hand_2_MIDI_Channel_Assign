## Alpha 0.1 update:

- First working iteration of the algorithm.
- Accuracy: ~82%
- Countour assignation for static keys needs refining:
  - For the black keys, they there is a noticable offset between calculated and actual area

### This update achieved:

### Coming up soon:

- Contour assignation fix:
  - In the next update, a contour area fine tuning will be added to compensate for any posisble offset.

### Eventually:

- Refine logical gates at Compare.py to increase output accuracy as well as improving the overall algoruithm speed.

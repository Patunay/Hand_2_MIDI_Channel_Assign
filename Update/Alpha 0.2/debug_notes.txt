debug example 4
possible solutions
refine midi ticks to absolute timing conversion
lower certainity threshhold
ioncrese radious of landmark

some contours are not landmarks rendering...(not huge problem since logic layer 3 fixes it)
some handcrossing will output a incorrect guess (because lower hand is hidden under higher hand and then is p[orccesed as a 1st instance])

BIG ISSUE!!!!!
starting at 1238, 3rd option is giving inverse results
